// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = " The second step of the SDLC is where all of the specified details are gathered. Requirements are defined and specifications are created. Research of the needs of the end users is performed. "
const Design = "In this step the details of the overall project is outlined. This includes user interfaces, system and network requirements."
const Implementation = "During this phase once the system design documents are recieved, the work is divided in modules/units and actual coding is started.   "
const TestingIntegration = " Testing stage the developers test the software for bugs and defects. During this phase all types of functional testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done as well as non-functional testing are also done."
const Maintain = " Once when the customers starts using the developed system then the actual problems comes up and needs to be solved from time to time. This process where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance."
